Check "yes" or "no." lf you claim that you will be harmed because of your activities within a particular organization or movement, it is important to explain those activities.
For example, if you are afraid that you will be harmed because of your political opinions and activities in opposition to your government, you must fully list any political organizations to which you belonged and what your role was in those organizations. If you belong to a particular organization, you should include documents that show that many other people who belong to that organization were arrested or killed by the government. Also, if you are not certain of the exact dates of your membership in a particular organization, state in your answer that you are providing approximate dates.
Tip: lf you belonged to a para-military or guerilla organization, or any armed group, you should consult an attorney before completing this application. Cases that involve giving material support to a terrorist organization can get quite complicated. Also, anyone who has persecuted others is barred from receiving a grant of asylum.

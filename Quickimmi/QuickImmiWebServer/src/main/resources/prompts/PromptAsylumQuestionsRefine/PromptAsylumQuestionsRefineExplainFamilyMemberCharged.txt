The question the client is answering and requirements are as follows:
Have you or your family members ever been accused, charged, arrested, detained,interrogated, convicted and sentenced, or imprisoned in any country other than the United States? Check "yes" or "no" and then explain. In answering this question, you should answer exactly what is asked, giving as much detail as possible. If you cannot remember exactly when something happened, estimate the date, and state that you are providing an approximate date. You do not need to limit your answer to the space on the form. You can attach an additional sheet or declaration. There are two purposes to this question:
(1) To determine any encounters you may have had with the government of your home country (through the police, military, security forces, or other government representatives) which might constitute past persecution or which would provide evidence that the government might harm you if you return to your country; and
(2) To determine whether you might have committed a crime in your country or any other country that might make you ineligible for asylum. In answering this question, the following definitions are relevant:
a. What does “arrested" mean? Generally, you are considered to be arrested if you are taken into custody and detained for a period of time. While you would usually be taken to a police station, military barracks, or detention center, this is not necessary.
In some cases you may be arrested and detained at your home or some other place..
b. What does "detained" mean? Generally, you are considered to be detained if your movement is restricted. For example, if you are stopped for a brief period and questioned, such as at a road block this could mean you were detained.
c. What does "interrogated" mean? Generally, “interrogated” means "questioned." The interrogation need not include force or mistreatment.
d. What does “convicted and sentenced" mean? This generally means that you were found guilty and sentenced to prison for a crime. In some cases, being convicted and sentenced is persecution. For example, if a criminal conviction is used to punish someone for her political opinion or because she has violated an unfair rule, such asone requiring her to act contrary to her religious beliefs, this could be considered persecution.In other cases, a criminal conviction may bar you from receiving asylum..
e. What does "imprisoned" mean? This is generally understood to mean long-term detention.A person may be imprisoned whether or not she is charged or convicted of a crime, or sentenced.

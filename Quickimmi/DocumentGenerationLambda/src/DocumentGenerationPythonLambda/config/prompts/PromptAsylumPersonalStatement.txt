Example Personal Statement:

My name is Tian Jinlong, holding a Chinese passport with the number NO.E61211111, male, born on July 30, 1966, and I am 57 years old this year. I started elementary school in 1973 and subsequently completed my junior high and senior high education. In 1983, I was admitted to Nankai University in Tianjin, China, where I studied World Economics and graduated in 1987. I married Wang Yuqi in June 1992 and have been single since our divorce in May 2016. I have two sons; my eldest son Tian Ye is 30 years old, and my younger son, named Tian Zhen, is 8 years old. After graduation, I worked at the Bank of China Tianjin branch, serving in positions such as ordinary staff, section member, and deputy section chief until July 1999. From August of that year to December 2000, I studied for an MBA at the School of Humanities at Tsinghua University in Beijing and obtained my postgraduate degree. Since then, I have been running my own business in the cultural media sector and founded the website www.zgmodels.com, which is involved in model training, fashion competitions, and fashion show performances. In 2010, I began investing in solar photovoltaic production, processing, and installation, and launched the website www.tjxgkj.com. In the same year, I founded a chain of billiards clubs, promoting billiards sports, billiards training, and organizing billiards competitions, and established the website www.zg147.com. By 2020, due to religious reasons, I no longer managed the billiards company. The other two companies were also forcibly shut down by the government in June 2022.
On July 21, 2023, I entered the United States from Los Angeles and am now seeking religious asylum. Below are the specifics of the persecution I faced.
My journey of faith began when I traveled to the United States for vacation in September 2019. During that time, I visited cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. The freedom, democracy, and openness of the U.S. left a deep impression on me. On September 7, I visited my classmates Zhang Jidong and Shi Yaoqiang and their spouse in Calgary, Canada (after graduating from college, they studied in Canada and have been living there for over 30 years and are now Canadian citizens). I stayed at their place for several days. They are Christians, and they introduced me to some aspects of Christianity, leading to two significant shifts in my perception: first, life is meaningful only with genuine faith; second, I began to question the atheistic education I received in mainland China and acknowledged the existence and omnipotence of God. I also joined them in saying grace before meals and daily prayers.
Upon returning to Tianjin, China, we frequently talked over the phone, discussing Christianity, and we would pray together at the end of our calls. The couple introduced me to their friend in Tianjin, Lu Lan, who is also a Christian. Lu Lan introduced me to several Christian believers in Tianjin. I attended bible study gatherings at the homes of Brother Wang Xin (located at Building 1, Unit 2, Room 402, Rongshui Lane, Jingwu Town, Xiqing District, Tianjin) and Brother Wu Jie (located at Building 28, Unit 2, Room 302, Xuhui Yannan Garden, Jingwu Town, Xiqing District, Tianjin). During these gatherings, local police twice entered the premises to check on us, recorded our personal information, and prohibited us from meeting. Later on, due to several talks by the local police station with them, I and other church members received several anonymous threatening phone calls. Eventually, the home churches of both Brother Wang Xin and Brother Wu Jie were completely shut down, leaving us with no place to gather.
After Brother Wang Xin and Brother Wu Jie's homes were no longer available for gatherings, we shifted our meetings to my company (located at Building B7, Room 103, 11 Xiangtan Road, Hongqiao District, Tianjin). On the morning of March 14, 2021, around 9 AM, thirteen of us from our Xiqing group were praying at my company. This was our third meeting at this location. Around 10 AM, two police officers from the Xigu Police Station drove into my company and informed us that the company's premises could not be used for church activities. I, being the organizer, was taken to the Xigu Police Station for further investigation.
Upon arrival at the police station, I was isolated in a small, closed room until about 1:30 PM. A young police officer then took me to an interrogation room. Alongside him was another officer in his 50s. They began by asking about my personal details such as age, gender, and ID number, followed by questions about when and how I joined the church, how often we met, etc. I answered all their questions truthfully. When I mentioned that my faith journey began during a trip abroad, the older officer left the room for nearly half an hour. When he returned, another officer in his 30s joined. He pointed out that I am an entrepreneur and a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for Hongqiao District in Tianjin (for both the 13th and 14th sessions). He emphasized that I've been educated under the Communist Party's materialistic values and should not believe in God. Instead, I should trust the Communist Party and socialism. He claimed that by holding unauthorized gatherings, I was setting a negative example for society.
They subsequently questioned me in-depth about my travels abroad: the people I met, the funds or assets I received, and the instructions I received from any group or individual. They insisted on getting information about foreign entities I might be associated with. I kept clarifying that my faith in Christianity was personal and had nothing to do with any organization. They meticulously questioned every aspect of my 20-day trip to the U.S. and Canada, from the cities I visited, sights I saw, people I dined with, conversations I had, and so on. By 6 PM, seeing that they couldn't extract any more information from me, they moved me back to the initial small room. Around 10 PM, fearing I might try to escape, they handcuffed my right hand to a radiator in a larger, monitored room, seemingly a night-shift room with a police officer on duty. I was in this position for nearly 10 hours, which caused severe pain in my waist, a pain that persists to this day. The next day, around 8 AM, I was taken to an office where I was threatened with arrest and severe punishment if I continued attending church activities. They also warned that due to my unauthorized religious activities and change in the designated use of the company property, they might recommend shutting down my company. After these threats, they released me. After returning home, aside from the physical pain, I lived in constant fear, particularly regarding the potential closure of my company. Meanwhile, I attended a government-registered church (located on the 14th floor of the Jiali Center in Nankai District, Tianjin) every Sunday, as recommended by Brother Wu Jie. However, even this government-approved church was shut down by the authorities at the end of 2021.
After I was detained in the local police station where my office is located for more than ten days, on March 30, 2021, parts of the self-built buildings of my two companies (Tianjin Shengshi Xuguang Solar Street Light Co., Ltd. and Tianjin Shengshi Yangguang Film and Television Cultural Communication Co., Ltd.) located at No. 103 and No. 101, Building B7, 11 Xiangtan Road, Hongqiao District, Tianjin, which cover an area of nearly 400 square meters, were ordered to be demolished by the Tianjin Hongqiao District Government Urban Management Bureau on the grounds of illegal construction. I argued on the basis of reason, stating that I was an entrepreneur introduced by the government's investment promotion in 2010 and had obtained government approval for self-built factories at that time. This building has been in existence for 11 years. However, they did not acknowledge this and, together with the local police station and the park owner with government background, Tianjin Carpet Management Co., Ltd., continued to harass the normal operations of my two companies. On March 30, 2021, they sealed my company, demanding the removal of company goods and office supplies. On April 4, 2021, water and electricity were unreasonably cut off. After the water and electricity were cut off, in order to fight for my rights, I insisted on living in the company for more than a year, during which time I faced numerous difficulties due to the lack of water and electricity. On June 16, 2022, in my absence, the urban management personnel, in collaboration with the police station, illegally broke the lock and entered my company. They moved all the company's items to the warehouse of the urban management bureau. I was not there on the day, and they moved more than 10 trucks of items. As a result, the company went bankrupt, and I suffered huge losses, and I could no longer continue to live in the company.
Over the past two years, I have petitioned at all levels of government. During the petitioning process, I was prevented from entering several times. When I requested to enter, I was restrained and brutally escorted by armed police, resulting in restriction of my personal freedom, causing multiple bruises all over my body and once again straining my waist. The issues I raised have not been resolved. In addition, every time I reported on the company's situation, I was repeatedly questioned about my involvement in Christianity. There were constant surveillance and tracking of my personal movements, making it impossible for me to participate in any social activities, let alone attend church gatherings or communicate offline with brothers and sisters.
During these dark days, I am grateful to my classmate Zhang Jidong, who often comforted me during our phone calls and prayed for me, asking God to pave the way for me. This made me less attached to the financial losses, and during the hardest times, I believed even more in the existence of God. With God's guidance, I went through the darkest days of persecution. But as one of God's people, I have grown more and more accepting of Christianity. I pray daily, but in mainland China, it's no longer possible to have a place to openly praise God.
Later, as my understanding of the Bible deepened, I gradually gave up petitioning and accusing the public security and government departments. I just stayed at home every day reading the Bible and praying. The public security authorities gradually relaxed their surveillance on me, and occasionally when I went out, no one called to ask where I was going. With the easing of the pandemic, when the time was right, I entered the United States under the pretext of tourism on July 21, 2023.
During my time in the United States, I have come to appreciate the importance of freedom even more. I can finally freely attend church services, communicate with brothers and sisters, and openly express my faith in God. On August 18, I was invited to attend an evangelistic meeting at Monterey Park Sky City Christian Church. That evening, I was deeply moved by the sermon of Pastor Lii Daihao from Taiwan. I immediately responded to Pastor Lti's call and decided to serve the Lord Jesus.
I am afraid to return to China, to a country without God and faith. I worry that if I leave and return, I will definitely be detained again and suffer persecution and torture. As a Christian, I didn't even have the opportunity to be baptized in China, let alone serve God openly. Therefore, I would like to apply for asylum, be baptized in the United States, and hope to serve God in the church in the future. I hope to be approved, thank you!
